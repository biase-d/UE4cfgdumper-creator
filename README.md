# UE4 Dumper & Creator

An enhanced, interactive version of the UE4 configuration dumper for the Nintendo Switch. This tool allows you to scan running Unreal Engine 4 & 5 games, manage past scans, and generate custom cheat files directly on your console

## Features

*   **Applet Mode:** Quickly scan a running game to find engine settings
*   **Manage Mode:** Browse, manage, and delete previous dumps
*   **Cheat Generation:** Automatically generates Atmosph√®re-compatible cheat files based on a powerful `config.json`

## How to Use

#### To Scan a Game (Applet Mode)
1. Launch your target game and get to the main menu
2. Press the HOME button, then open the Album to launch the Homebrew Menu
3. Run `UE4cfgdumper+creator`. The scan will begin automatically

#### To Manage Dumps (Manage Mode)
1. Close any running game
2. Hold the 'R' button while launching any game icon from the Switch Home Menu to open the Homebrew Menu in Title Mode
3. Run `UE4cfgdumper+creator`. You will be greeted with the interactive management menu
